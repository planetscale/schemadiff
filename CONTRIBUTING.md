# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. However, we regret to inform you that we do not accept external contributions at this time. We strive to deliver the software as is, and as a service to the community. Our team otherwise focuses its efforts elsewhere.

As a reminder, `schemadiff` is a command line wrapper around `schemadiff` library. If you encounter any issues related to the logic of the `schemadiff` library, please report them in the [vitessio/vitess](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess) repository (open a new issue [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/new/choose)).

Thank you for looking into `schemadiff`.
